In the brainstorming section we go through 2 excercises

* Cards game - To generate a _keywords map_
* 6 Boxes - To use the keywords map to identify _themes_

### Cards game 

#### Why

We want to explore a lot of ideas for what you can talk about. This game will help us do so by creating a keywords map.
We want you to delve deeper into your areas of expertise and discover things you are passionate about. 
The statements/questions on the card will help you do so.

#### How to play 

Pick a card, read the statement, write down the answer. 

* Be quick 
  * Write the first thing you think of
  * Feel free to skip questions 
  * Use your interpretation of the questions
* Keep it short - prefer keywords over sentences 
* More is better - the more questions you answer, the more you have to pick from

The questions from the cards can also be found [here](card_game_questions.md)

### 6 Boxes 

#### Why

This is to take all the ideas you generated in the keywords map and try to cluster them into themes. 

#### How to use

* Draw a grid with 6 boxes
* Take a keyword/idea from the map generated in the card game and put it in the box
* Take the next one, if it fits in the same box thematically, add it to that box. If not, add it to the next box
* Carry on till you run out of ideas, boxes or time
* Try to give a theme to each of the boxes of ideas you have

You should end up with up to six themes you can use for the next part of the workshop
